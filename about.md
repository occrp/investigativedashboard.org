<b>ID</b> is an
<abbr title="Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project">OCCRP</abbr>
service that helps investigative journalists within the network conduct
research quickly and effectively.

A team of researchers and data specialists is on hand to track down people,
companies, and assets — like ships and planes — anywhere in the world.

They are equipped with access to a number of commercial search engines and
databases, as well as the experience to make effective use of dozens of
publicly available, but little-known, open sources.

The team also supports investigations in need of data acquisition, wrangling,
and analysis of data.

With the support of a bespoke ticketing system to shorten the lead time from
story inception to publication, the research team helps OCCRP members break new
ground in investigative journalism.

### History

The Investigative Dashboard was developed by Paul Cristian Radu (OCCRP) and
Justin Arenstein (ANCIR) while they both were in residence at Stanford
University as Knight Fellows.

The John S. Knight Fellowships for Professional Journalists made the dashboard
possible by providing access to the know-how of fellow journalists and of
experts at Stanford University and in Silicon Valley.

## About OCCRP

As an investigative reporting platform for an ever-growing
<a class="mid-gray dim" href="https://www.occrp.org/en/members">worldwide
network of independent media centers</a> and journalists, OCCRP is reinventing
investigative journalism for the 21st century as a public good.
In the face of rising costs and growing threats to independent media, OCCRP
provides media outlets and journalists with a range of critical resources and
tools including digital and physical security and allows those covering the
most sensitive topics to work in teams with trusted editors.

While upholding the highest journalistic ethics and editorial standards, OCCRP
develops and deploys cutting-edge tech tools to enable collaborative, secure
data-driven investigations.
With <a class="mid-gray dim" href="https://aleph.occrp.org">OCCRP Aleph</a>,
an investigative data platform powered by software we developed, journalists
can search and cross-reference more than one billion records to trace criminal
connections and patterns and efficiently collaborate across borders.

OCCRP also <a class="mid-gray dim"
href="https://www.occrp.org/en/gacc/">partners with advocacy groups</a>, arming
civil society with information to meaningfully press for justice and change,
and unearths evidence that enables law enforcement to act.

We see a future where corruption and organized crime are drastically reduced
and democracy is strengthened as a result of a more informed citizenry,
increased accountability, and sharply higher costs for criminal activity.
