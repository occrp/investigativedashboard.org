<b>ID</b> is an
<a class="mid-gray dim" href="https://www.occrp.org/en/about-us"
  title="Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project">OCCRP</a>
service that helps investigative journalists in the OCCRP network conduct
research quickly and effectively. OCCRP's research team runs ID.

A team of expert researchers and data specialists is available  to help track
down people, companies, and assets — like ships and planes — anywhere in the
world.
We are equipped with access to a number of commercial search engines and
databases as well as the experience to make effective use of dozens of
publicly available, but little-known, open sources. Services also include
assistance with data acquisition, wrangling, and analysis.

With the support of a bespoke ticketing system to shorten the lead time from
story inception to publication, the research team helps OCCRP’s member centers
and partners to break new ground in investigative journalism.

## History

OCCRP ID was developed by OCCRP co-founder Paul Radu and Justin Arenstein from
the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting  while they were
both John S. Knight Fellows in residence at Stanford University in 2010.

## Supporters

ID has been generously supported by the governments of the United States, the
United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, and the European Union as well as by the Open
Society Foundations, Sigrid Rausing Trust, and the National Endowment for
Democracy.

ID was developed in collaboration with
